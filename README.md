# NYC Green Gentrification Analysis

This repository investigates whether resilience infrastructure investments in NYC lead to climate gentrification and displacement. It combines ACS, PLUTO, ACRIS, and Resilience Project data into tract-level and parcel-level panels from 2013–2023.

## 🔍 Project Overview
- **Goal**: Detect spatial and temporal spillover effects of resilience infrastructure on rent and eviction risk.
- **Methodology**: Spatial Error Models (SEM), DiD, and machine learning models.
- **Key Insight**: Infrastructure projects show modest rent effects with spatial spillovers, prompting equity-policy recommendations.
